\label{project}
There are often many sounds around you that you do not require. Some of these can even be disturbing due to their volume, or perhaps just the type of sound that they are. These "nuisance" sounds can often interfere with your hearing of other, desired sounds, for example causing you to miss what people are saying. This project aims to provide a solution for this whereby you can remove those unwanted sounds from what you hear.
