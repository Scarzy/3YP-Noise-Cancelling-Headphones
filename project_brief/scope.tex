\label{scope}
This project can be extended through the use of additions of varying complexity. At the simpler end it could account for multiple nuisance sources, or to allow you to select the nuisance source as a required source, and to cancel everything else. Increasing in complexity to it trying to detect nuisance sounds autonomously, based on them being cyclic or of an annoying pitch.
