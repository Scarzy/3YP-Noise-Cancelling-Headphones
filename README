3YP Selective Active Noise Cancelling Headphones

Author:		Thomas Scarsbrook
Supervisor:	Steve Gunn
Examiner:	Rob Maunder

These are the files for the selective noise cancelling headphones that I am
producing for my third year project. The headphones remove a single noise
source from the users ears.

Directory structure:
docs - Documents sourced from other sources, stored purely for ease of reference
management - Documents relating to the management of the project
reports - The various reports required for the project
	project_brief - The project brief LaTeX files
	progress_report - The progress report LaTeX files
	final_report - The final report LaTeX files
work - The code and schematics etc for the production of the project
	code - The C code for the DSP
	ccs4 - The project used in CCS4 for loading onto the DSP
	extra - Unrelated code, such as producing input sequences
	matlab - MATLAB code to model the system
	schematics - The schematics for the hardware side of the system
	headphone-reverse-engineer - The reverse engineered schematic of the
				     philips headphones

Please note that this project is spread across multiple branches. In order to
view all relevant files you will have to switch branches at times.
Branches can be switched using the following command:

% git checkout <branch>

The branches of interest are:
	master - Contains the majority of the work.
		 This is where to find the correlation algorithm code, all reports, and hardware details.
	hw-ini - Contains the files relating to the hardware design.
		 This branch has been merged into master.
	lms    - Contains the files relating to the LMS algorithm.
	lms_linux - Contains the LMS files used in the linux simulation
