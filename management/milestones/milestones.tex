\subsection{Milestone 1}
Record and replay audio through DSP
\subsubsection{Requirements}
The DSP must be capable of taking in audio data and playing it back.
This must be completely independant of any built in functionality eg. DSK functions, as these will not apply when moved onto a PCB.
\subsubsection{Achieved}
Date achieved:		\\
Percentage achieved:


\subsection{Milestone 2}
Cancel one audio signal from another
\subsubsection{Requirements}
Gain the mathematical functionality to detect one audio signal inside another, and to then cancel it out.
\subsubsection{Achieved}
Date achieved:		\\
Percentage achieved:

\subsection{Milestone 3}
Move audio cancellation onto DSP
\subsubsection{Requirements}
Take the mathematically described audio cancelling functionality as defined in milestone 2, and achieve it on the DSP.
\subsubsection{Achieved}
Date achieved:		\\
Percentage achieved:	\\

\subsection{Milestone 4}
Create PCB
\subsubsection{Requirements}
The system will be on a PCB on which the DSP can be programmed, and operate.
The system must be able to achieve all prior functionality just no longer on an evaluation board.
