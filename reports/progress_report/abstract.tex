There are many undesired sounds around us all the time.
These sounds can often be very distracting to what we are attempting to hear.
There are various methods we can employ in an attempt to reduce the effect of these undesired sounds
So far I have experimented with one method of cancelling these out with a measured amount of success, however it is not optimal and suffers from some physical limitations.
I am also looking into an alternative, potentially much faster method of achieving the cancellation.
