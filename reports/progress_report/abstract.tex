There are many undesired sounds around us all the time.
These sounds can often be very distracting to what we are attempting to hear.
There are various methods that can be employed in an attempt to reduce the effect of these undesired sounds.
So far one method of cancelling these out has been experimented with, with a measured amount of success, however it is not optimal and suffers from some physical limitations.
An alternative, potentially much faster, method of achieving the cancellation is being looked into.
