\section{Active Noise Cancelling Headphones}
Headphones using ANC technology have been in existence for a fair while, and many companies are producing them to give you clearer sound quality for your audio.
The majority of these systems are designed to either cancel out all surrounding noise, or to cancel all noise in a specific frequency range.
As such, systems can be built that will cancel the surrounding mechanical and engine noises in an aeroplane, but when someone speaks to you these sounds are passed through.
This can greatly simplify the methods used as certain factors are known, such as the exact sound that is being cancelled without any time delay, amplitude or phase effects.
In these cases the system needs merely to invert the signal and play it in order that the two cancel each other out\cite{EMNoiseCancel}.

However, at times a more selective methodology is used. For example, in an ambulance the driver and paramedics will require to hear each other talking and any sounds from the various devices or the patient clearly, but they do not wish to hear the wail of the siren less than a meter above their head\cite{EMHeadsets}.
To account for this some statistical analysis can be used to determine the characteristics of the sounds, and any sounds with characteristics that match the known ones of the sirens can be cancelled.
This can be achieved thanks to prior knowledge of the types of sound that is being heard.
