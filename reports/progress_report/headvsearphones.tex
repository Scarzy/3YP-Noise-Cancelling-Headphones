\section{Headphones vs. Earphones}
There are two types of headphones available on the market.
One set sit around your ears with padding holding the speaker just off your ear. These are generally held in place using a band passing over the top of the head.
The other type are often referred to as 'earphones', these are much smaller and sit inside the ear, held in place by a rubber seal. The left and right earphone are normally completely disconnected from each other, as such it is easier to use just one or the other rather than both at once.
