\chapter{What Comes Next}

This chapter describes what I intend to do until in the coming few months.
I will be advancing the project in two ways, I will be generating hardware for it, and I will be continuing to modify the software involved.

\section{Hardware}
\subsection{PCB}
Once the code is functional on the DSP, the next step is to move it off the evaluation board and onto a specially designed PCB.

\section{Algorithm}
\subsection{LMS}
Least Mean Squares (LMS) is an alternative method for achieving the cancellation.
Where my current method could perhaps be considered to be a bit of a ``Brute force'' method, LMS is a cleaner, neater method.
LMS is a form of adaptive filter,

\subsection{ICA}
Independant Component Analysis (ICA) is a method for identifying and separating multiple sound sources without prior knowledge of what they are.
