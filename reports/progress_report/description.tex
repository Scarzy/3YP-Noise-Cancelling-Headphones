\section{Project Description}
The aim of this project is to produce the electronics for a set of headphones which will be capable of detecting and cancelling an unwanted sound source from that being heard by the user.

There are many distractions in the world today, and almost every single one of them produces sound of some sort.
These sounds can be disturbing from trying to hear a specific sound, such as a telephone call.
However not all of these sounds are unwanted.
Headphones exist on the market to cancel out all the sounds hitting the ear, so that only the sound being produced by them is heard, but they do not account for other sounds.

Sat in a pub talking with some friends, there is music blaring out of speakers all around.
It is desirable to be able to hear people talking over the music, current noise cancelling headphones don't account for this.
This project aims to address this by taking in a noise signal as well as the sound being heard, and then determining how much of the `nuisance' signal is contained in the signal reaching the users ears.
Once this has been determined, along with any delays or phase shifts being accounted for, a cancelling signal can then be played into the users ears, resulting in only the unwanted sound being removed.
