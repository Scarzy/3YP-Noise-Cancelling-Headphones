I would like to thank my supervisor Steve Gunn for all his support and advice
during this project.
I would also like to thank the members of Student Robotics, who not only helped
me come up with the idea of this project, but also introduced me to many of the
pieces of software used in the project.
Also there are all the people who assisted with the proof reading of the
reports, including a couple of the people on my course, my parents, and some of
my sixth form teachers.
