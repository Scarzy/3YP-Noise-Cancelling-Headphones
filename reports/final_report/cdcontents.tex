These are the files for the selective noise cancelling headphones that I am
producing for my third year project. The headphones remove a single noise
source from the users ears.

Please note that this project is spread across multiple branches. In order to\\
view all relevant files you will have to switch branches at times.\\
Branches can be switched using the following command:
\\
\\
\emph{$>$ git checkout $<branch>$}
\\
\\
The branches of interest are:\\
\indent	master - Contains the majority of the work.\\
\indent	\indent	 This is where to find the correlation algorithm code,\\
\indent	\indent	all reports, and hardware details.\\
\indent	hw-ini - Contains the files relating to the hardware design.\\
\indent	\indent	 This branch has been merged into master.\\
\indent	lms    - Contains the files relating to the LMS algorithm.\\
\indent	lms\_linux - Contains the LMS files used in the linux simulation
