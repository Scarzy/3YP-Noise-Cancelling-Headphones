\section{Hardware}

After production, the PCB was tested to check it matched the required design.
Some problems were discovered before and during testing, these are discussed in appendix \ref{ssec:testHWprobs}.

\subsection{Results}
Despite the aforementioned problems in production, many parts of the PCB could still be tested.
Test conditions used are stated in appendix \ref{ssec:testHWconds}.
This section only covers the basic results from the testing, a more detailed analysis is in appendix \ref{ssec:testHWresults}.

\subsubsection{Power}
Firstly the power circuitry was tested.
The voltages provided by the regulators, and the LED status were checked.
This section of the circuitry functioned correctly.

\subsubsection{DSP}
As discussed in section \ref{ssec:testHWprobs} the DSP was not programmable by the end of the project, this limited the testability of the supporting circuitry.
\subsubsection{Codec}
Unfortunately, without being able to program the DSP it is not possible to configure the codec to interact.
However, there is a second part to that circuit that can be tested; the clock generator.

The clock generator produced the desired output. 

\subsubsection{Analogue}
The frequency response of the signal conditioning amplifier was tested, to check it would provide the correct attenuation.
An acceptable frequency response was observed.
