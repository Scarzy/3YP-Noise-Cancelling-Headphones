There are many undesired sounds around us all the time.
These sounds can often be very distracting to what we are attempting to hear.
There are various methods that can be employed in an attempt to reduce the
effect of these undesired sounds.
Two algorithms are tested in this project, each with their own degrees of
success and their own limitations.
The hardware to support these algorithms was also developed.
