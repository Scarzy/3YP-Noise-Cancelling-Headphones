\section{PCB}

Along with the algorithmic side of the project, the hardware on which the algorithm would run was designed and produced.
This was produced in the form of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) upon which would be placed the circuitry to run the various algorithms.
The necessary supporting electronics also had to be located on this PCB.

Due to the nature under which the system would be used, various features were required from the PCB.
Most significant the PCB had to be portable.
Headphones are generally used in circumstances where the users are moving about, sometimes in high risk circumstances.
As such the electronics on the PCB must not have interfered with the users' actions.
\\
\\
For starters, the PCB had to be compact.
Ideally, it should be of a size capable of fitting comfortably into a small pocket.
This would help prevent the system from mechanically interfering with the user.
Another aspect in which the PCB was designed so as not to impede the user was the power consumption.
The system had to be low power - capable of being powered by battery for an extended period of time.
This would allow the user to be mobile.
