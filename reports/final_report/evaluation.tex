\section{Evaluation}

The aims of this project were slightly optimistic and allowances for potential problems in the implementation were not accounted for fully.
As such this project currently consists of a framework for cancelling through a couple of different methods, however no actual functionality is achieved.
One of these methods is inefficient with the hardware, requiring faster implementation than the hardware was capable of providing.
The other method suffering from instabilities and inaccuracies in application.
\\

The PCB for the project was functional are far as testing would permit, however was let down by the programming capabilities.
This was down to a few causes, however a significant one is limitations in availability of the BSDL file from the manufacturer.
This is the file describing the internal JTAG layout of the device, required for any JTAG programming.
