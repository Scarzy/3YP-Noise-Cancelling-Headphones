\section{Software}
The algorithmic side of the system was implemented in the C programming language, due to the amount of control it provided and the fact that the available compilers required C.

\subsubsection{Ring Buffers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ring buffers
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ADV.
	\item Optimisation of sums, like mean
	\item Not needing to worry about location in array, just use ptr
	\item Easy to implement
	\item DIS.
	\item Complexity in implementation
	\item Extra computation required
	\end{itemize}
\item Isolating codec comms from algorithm
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ADV.
	\item Simplicity of changing codec interface
	\item 
	\item DIS.
	\item 
	\end{itemize}
\item Self writing all code
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ADV.
	\item 
	\item DIS.
	\item 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correlation}

After writing the code for the correlation algorithm, a problem was discovered.
The algorithm for cross-correlation requires the use of the mean in the calculation.
Whilst the mean could be calculated easily due to the 

\subsection{LMS}
