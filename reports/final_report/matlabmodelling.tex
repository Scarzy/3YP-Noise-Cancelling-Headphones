\section{Matlab}
In order to aid the design of the algorithms matlab models were produced and
tested.

\subsection{Correlation}

\subsection{LMS}
The LMS algorithm was modelled in two ways.
Firstly an inbuilt toolbox of matlab was used, in order to provide a model to test this projects code against.

The second model produced was using a structure that was more compatible with how it would be implemented on the DSP.
